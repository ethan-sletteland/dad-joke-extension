## Dad joke chrome extension client

I just wanted to see what chrome extensions are made of. This extension opens a WebSocket connection to a Node server I deployed to `ws://sleepy-reef-66846.herokuapp.com`, a native Node/HTML client is available at `https://sleepy-reef-66846.herokuapp.com/chat.html`, and an Angular client is available at `http://ethan.slette.land/dadbot/joke-bot`
